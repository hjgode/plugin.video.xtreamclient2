# Simple xtream example plugin for Kodi mediacenter

This is a simple yet fully functional example of a xtream client video plugin for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) mediacenter, version 19 (Matrix).
Please read the comments in the plugin code for more details.
An installable .zip can be downloaded from "[Releases]" tab.
Do **not** try to install a .zip generated by GitHub.

I wrote this to learn a bit about python and Kodi, so this is not perfect code and some things are done different. Another motiviation was the terrible slow PVR Simple IPTV client, as it doesonly support playlist and no filter.

The plugin.video.xtreamclient supports filtering. Either simply looking at the start of category names or using a regex. So I can filter only categories starting with "DE " or all categories having "DE " or "TR " (regex for this is "^(DE |TR )" for all categories starting with "DE " or "TR ". See plugin>Other Settings.).
